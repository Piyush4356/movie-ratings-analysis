# 🎬 Movie Ratings Analysis

This project analyzes the **TMDB 5000 Movies dataset** using Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques.  
The goal is to explore patterns in movie performance, understand the relationship between budgets, revenues, and ratings,  
and apply sentiment analysis on movie overviews. A regression model is also built to predict movie revenue.

## 📊 Key Highlights
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on 5000+ movies  
- Built a **Regression Model** to predict box office revenue  
- Conducted **Sentiment Analysis** of movie overviews using NLP  
- Created **Visualizations** including scatter plots, heatmaps, and word clouds  
- Structured the project in a professional format with separate `src/`, `notebooks/`, and `data/` folders

## 🛠️ Tech & Skills Used
- **Programming:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, evaluation with R² & RMSE  
- **NLP:** TextBlob, WordCloud for sentiment analysis & visualization  
- **Data Handling:** Cleaning, preprocessing, merging datasets (movies + credits)  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Anaconda
